# CIFAR10

This is "solution" to a CIFAR10 dataset. This is my first model. It's accuracy is aproximately 80%, not lower. 
File main.py trains the model in image classification and saves it's parameters to a file. Said file's size is 211MB.
FIle fun.py is a lovely little program that allows you to test already trained neural network. You simply need to input the path to a parameters and png image.
